## Week 1: Historical Introduction to Text and Writing - 
- Information storage before computers include diffent number systems and writings.
- Writing evolved from early symbolic representations, such as cave paintings, to complex scripts like cuneiform and alphabets.
- Technologies developed like typewriters and keyboards standardized text formatting, influencing communication.
- From Mesopotamian cylinder seals to Gutenbergâ€™s press, printing technolgy drastically enabled many cultural shifts.

## Week 2: Representing Text and Numbers in Computers
- Computers store and process data using the binary system, where bits (0s and 1s) represent numbers and characters.
- Volatile memory (RAM) is used for temporary, fast-access data but loses information when powered off, whereas non-volatile storage (SSD, HDD) retains data long-term.
- Early computing used punch cards and Morse code, evolving into modern file structures, text editors, and storage systems.

## Week 3: Structure of Text
- Text formatting in software development relies on structured formats like Markdown and HTML, where indentation, special characters, and escaping ensure proper display and functionality.
-  Unicode provides a standardized system for representing text across different languages and symbols, with UTF-8 being the most widely used encoding due to its efficiency in handling diverse characters.
- Tools like GitHub utilize Markdown for documentation, and browsers process structured data (HTML, JSON, XML) using rendering engines like Blink and WebKit to display content correctly.

## Week 4: Manipulating Text & Text Editors
- Efficient typing and familiarity with different keyboard layouts (QWERTY, Dvorak, etc.) improve productivity.
- Advanced search methods like regex allow developers to efficiently locate patterns in text, enhancing productivity in text manipulation tasks.
- GitHub facilitates version control and collaboration, while GitHub Pages allows developers to host web pages directly from repositories, enabling easy project deployment.

## Week 5 : Command Line Interfaces
- Text-based communication between a human and a computer
- The command line interface (CLI) provides faster execution of certain tasks, enables automation through scripting, and allows for efficient remote work with minimal resource usage.
- Basic navigation and file management commands are fundamental for interacting with a system, while advanced commands like grep and redirection enhance text processing capabilities.
- Secure Shell (SSH) enables remote system management, while tools like htop, tmux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provide advanced monitoring and seamless integration between Windows and Linux environments.
